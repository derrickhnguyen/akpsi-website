								i I was looking for an organization that had the "Whole-shabang." I happened to find that with Alpha Kappa Psi. It offered everything from service, social, cultural diversity, and professionalism (an aspect that many other fraternities and sororities didn't have). AKPsi has taught me many things, including the core values that will shape me into a principled business leader. If you want to be surrounded by a group of driven individuals, who will push you to excel above your limits, look no further; its AKPsi.

								i As an active member, I was able to practice what I learned in the classroom. Being historian helped me learn and grow as an artist. I was in a fail-safe learning environment that provided me the tools to succeed once I completed my education. The single most important thing I gained from being in Alpha Kappa Psi was a group of individuals who pushed me to better myself as a person. They helped build my confidence and believed in me as an artist. They believed in me when I felt incompetent. They were overfilled with joy when something marvelous happened. Some even stayed in an art room with me 'til 4 in the morning while I finished up a project. They are my brothers and they always will be.

In addition, it helped me develop professional skills that helped me with my resume, time management abilities and presentation skills. But more than that, this fraternity has given me friendships that I know will extend beyond the chapter and last for years to come.

						b What is Rush?
					p 
						b Rush week, more officially known as recruitment week, is the period of time when fraternities and sororities recruit students to their respective Greek organizations. Rush week usually happens during the beginning of the semester. During rush, fraternities and sororities have slightly different practices, but they all involve students getting to know more about Greek life. Fraternities then give “bids,” - invitations to join the fraternity - to students they want as pledges. Students can then pledge to join and go through an initiation process to become a full member or they can refuse the bid.

								b (From UC Davis' Chapter)
				div.row
					div.col-md-12(class="top-space")
						h4.blue Q: What is rush?
						p Rush is a series of events over a week to allow potential rushees the opportunity to learn more about Alpha Kappa Psi while in turn allowing the Active Brothers to learn more about interested candidates.
					div.col-md-12(class="top-space")
						h4.blue Q: What is Alpha Kappa Psi?
						p One of two professional business fraternities on campus, Alpha Kappa Psi offers much more than professional development and social networking. The Active Brothers of Alpha Kappa Psi are successful students motivated to achieve even greater accomplishments, in and out of the work place. Alumni Brothers lead interesting and rewarding careers. Alpha Kappa Psi also appreciates the contributions by every major toward business, proved by our open-major rush. We invite you to learn more about the fraternity at our upcoming rush events.
					div.col-md-12(class="top-space")
						h4.blue Q: Do I have to be a business-oriented major to apply?
						p Absolutely not. Alpha Kappa Psi recognizes the universal nature of business. Professionalism is required of all industries. Alpha Kappa Psi is open to all majors.
					div.col-md-12(class="top-space")
						h4.blue Q: How is Alpha Kappa Psi different from other business fraternities?
						p Alpha Kappa Psi offers a wide range of opportunities, allowing our Active Brothers to excel where they choose. Because Alpha Kappa Psi is open to all majors, the breadth of knowledge gained and shared by the Active Brothers and Alumni Brothers allow us to offer innovative perspectives on business and beyond.
					div.col-md-12(class="top-space")
						h4.blue Q: Is attending all the rush events required?
						p Although attendance to rush events is voluntary, it is highly encouraged that serious applicants attend all rush events. Due to the high traffic of our rush, it is difficult to remember every rush candidate. The more interactions an individual has with our fraternity, the more he or she can learn about Alpha Kappa Psi and the more we can learn about him or her.
					div.col-md-12(class="top-space")
						h4.blue Q: What type of rush candidates are you looking for?
						p There is no pre-set image of the ideal rush candidate as we recognize the different contributions that various individuals can make. However, we are still looking for highly motivated scholars that not only work well independently, but within a group as well. Potential, as well as present qualities, is a determining factor in the bid process.
					div.col-md-12(class="top-space")
						h4.blue Q: If I do not get a bid the first time, can I rush again?
						p It is highly encouraged that a rush candidate apply again if he or she did not receive a bid the first time. Determination and personal refinement are valued traits in rush candidates.
